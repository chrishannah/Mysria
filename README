~~~~~Mysria~~~~~

~~Description

Mysria will be a top-down adventure game, with a very very pixely monochrome look! This game will only feature tones of purple! 

In the game you will travel through Mysria	, doing stuff and not doing stuff. 

I want it to be some kind of single player/exploration/story thing. So you can level up your character, but it will only be temporary levels, so like Mario Bros. when you die you go back to you normal state, so for example for each level you go up your attack points rise and health rises and when you die you go back to standard specifications.

~~How to run

To run it atm, just download the files to a .zip, rename to a .love and then download LOVE from https://love2d.org/ to run!

~~Monsters
 ~Slug
 These aren't dangerous at all, they are just minor pests that can get in your way. Feel free to kill as many as you wish.
